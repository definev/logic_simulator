## Overview

The Logic Gate Simulator is a powerful tool built using the Flutter framework that allows users to experiment with and visualize the behavior of various digital logic gates. Whether you're a student studying digital electronics, an educator looking for a teaching aid, or an electronics enthusiast, this simulator provides a user-friendly platform to explore and understand logic gates and their interactions.

## Features

### 1. Intuitive User Interface

The Logic Gate Simulator boasts an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface designed to make digital logic experimentation accessible to everyone. The interface is clean, responsive, and optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.

### 2. Multiple Logic Gates

The simulator supports a wide range of logic gates, including:

- AND gates
- OR gates
- NOT gates
- XOR gates
- NAND gates
- NOR gates
- XNOR gates

You can easily drag and drop these gates onto the canvas, connect them, and create complex logic circuits.

### 3. Real-time Simulation

Experience real-time logic gate behavior as you create and modify circuits. Watch as the output of gates updates dynamically based on the input signals.

### 4. Circuit Saving and Loading

Save your logic circuits for future reference or share them with others. The simulator allows you to save your work and load previously created circuits with ease.

### 5. Truth Tables

Generate truth tables for your circuits to help you understand the logic behind them and verify their functionality.

### 6. Circuit Export

Export your circuits in various formats, including images or text, for use in presentations, reports, or further analysis.

### 7. Customizable Appearance

Tailor the appearance of your logic gates and wires to your liking, making your circuits visually appealing and easy to understand.

### 8. Comprehensive Documentation

Access thorough documentation and tutorials within the app to help you get started and master the simulator's features.
